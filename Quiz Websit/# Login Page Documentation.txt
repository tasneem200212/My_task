# Login Page Documentation

## Overview
The login page is an essential part of the application. It serves as a gateway for users to access the quiz functionality. Without logging in, users can only view information about quiz topics. This document provides a detailed explanation of the page's structure, functionality, and implementation.

---

## Purpose
- Allow registered users to log in and access the quiz.
- Restrict unregistered users to only viewing information related to quiz topics.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the page structure.
- **CSS**: For styling the page elements.
- **JavaScript**: For adding functionality and validation.

---

## Page Structure

### 1. **Form Fields**
- **Email Input Field**
  - Placeholder: "Enter your email address"
  - Example of a valid email: `example@example.com`
- **Password Input Field**
  - Placeholder: "Enter your password"

### 2. **Checkbox**
- Label: "Remember Me"
- Functionality: Saves the email and password in the input fields using `localStorage`, so they are automatically filled when returning to the login page.

### 3. **Button**
- Label: "Login"
- Actions:
  1. Checks if the email field is empty.
  2. Ensures the email is in the correct format.
  3. Checks if the password field is empty.
  4. Verifies if the email and password exist in `localStorage`.

### 4. **Validation Messages**
- Displayed below the login button when conditions are not met:
  1. "Please enter your email address." (If the email field is empty)
  2. "Sorry, the email is written incorrectly." (If the email does not match the required format)
  3. "Please enter your password." (If the password field is empty)
  4. "The email or password was not found." (If the credentials are not found in `localStorage`)

### 5. **Link**
- Located below the form.
- Label: "Register"
- Redirects users to the account creation page.

## Functionality

### Validation Workflow
1. **Email Field**:
   - Checks that the field is not empty.
   - Validates the format using a regular expression.
2. **Password Field**:
   - Checks that the field is not empty.
3. **LocalStorage Verification**:
   - Looks for matching email and password in `localStorage`.
   - Displays an error message if no match is found.

### "Remember Me" Functionality
- When the checkbox is selected, the email and password are saved in `localStorage`.
- When returning to the page, the input fields are pre-filled with the saved data.

---

## Notes
- Validation messages are styled and displayed below the login button to enhance the user experience.
- The login page currently lacks advanced security features, such as encryption or server-side validation, as it is built using frontend-only technologies.

---

## Conclusion
The login page ensures a smooth user experience by validating inputs and allowing seamless access to the quiz. It utilizes local storage for convenience while maintaining simplicity through frontend technologies only.
